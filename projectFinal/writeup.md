# Final Project: Program Acceleration With NVIDIA CUDA

## Introduction
In previous projects we were able to observe the performance benefits of better utilizing the CPU (central processing unit) hardware resources with multithreading and x86 SIMD instructions. As we have learned CPUs are designed for a wide range of general-purpose tasks making them very versatile. However, this versatility has the drawback of lack of specialization where the CPU may not be able to efficiently perform a single type of task. On the other hand, GPUs (graphics processing unit) are not designed for a wide range of tasks and are able to perform 1 task, being parallel processing. In this project we will be utilizing the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit to execude code directly using the GPU. Various tests throughout programs will be performed to understand the benefits of utilizing a GPU in specific applications.
