# Project 2: Dense/Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication
## Introduction
This project details the effects of multithreading, single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions, and cache optimization on multiplying large densely and sparsely populated matrices. For reference, a dense matrix is a matrix where there are more non-zero elements than zero elements. A sparce matrix is a matrix in which there are more zero elements than non-zero elements. <br />
